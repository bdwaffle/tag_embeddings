                    <h1>Porn Tag embeddings</h1>
                    <p>I've been scraping (responsibly) a popular porn tracker called Empornium for a while. Each torrent has a number of tags associated with it, including things like sex acts
                        (<em>cowgirl</em>, <em>missionary</em>, etc.), studios/actresses (<em>povd.com</em>, <em>riley.reid</em>, etc.) as well as metadata for the specific release (<em>1080p</em>, <em>60.fps</em>)
                    </p>
                    <p>I took the torrents that I scraped (~7500 rows) and each tag associated with that torrent, and created word2vec embeddings of the tags, taking the list of tags for a specific torrent as a "sentence".
                    </p>
                    <p>Click below to view the tnse embeddings for the word2vec output. Once it loads, <b>click TSNE in the bottom left</b>, click stop, change perplexity to 30, and click Re-run. then click stop after a couple hundred iterations (once it starts to converge to some interesting clusters)</p>
                    <p>You can enter a tag to search for in the right to view the most similar tags (in the original 150-dim vector space)</p>
                    <p>Some interesting tags:
                        <ul>
                            <li>lubed.com - related tags are other sites from the same POVD.com network</li>
                            <li>femdom</li>
                            <li>elsa.jean - most similar tags are actresses she works with often and studios she's made many videos for</li>
                            <li>gangbang</li>
                            <li>charlotte.sarte - identifies heavily.tattooed, goth as related tags</li>
                            <li>kink.com - most similar tags are ball.gag, rough.sex etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
